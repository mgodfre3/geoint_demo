CHANGE DETECTION REPORT — PENTAGON OBSERVATION ZONE
Classification: UNCLASSIFIED // FOR DEMO USE ONLY
Date: 2026-02-23

AREA OF INTEREST: Pentagon and Immediate Surroundings
COORDINATES: 38.8719°N, 77.0563°W
COMPARISON PERIOD: 2026-02-16 to 2026-02-23

METHODOLOGY:
Multi-temporal satellite imagery comparison using automated change detection algorithms. 
Imagery sources include Sentinel-2 (10m resolution) and commercial high-resolution 
providers (0.5m resolution).

DETECTED CHANGES:
1. PARKING LOT SOUTH — Vehicle count decreased from 4,200 to 3,800 (weekend pattern)
2. HELIPAD AREA — New temporary structure (tent/canopy) erected, approximately 15m x 10m
3. NORTH COURTYARD — Vegetation maintenance activity (mowing patterns visible)
4. SOUTH LOADING DOCK — Two additional shipping containers present vs. baseline
5. METRO ENTRANCE — Construction scaffolding remains in place (ongoing renovation)

NO CHANGE (CONFIRMED STABLE):
- Perimeter security positions unchanged
- Roof infrastructure (HVAC, communications) unchanged
- Road access points unchanged
- Adjacent Arlington Cemetery boundaries unchanged

SIGNIFICANCE ASSESSMENT:
All detected changes are consistent with routine operations and maintenance activities. 
No indicators of unusual activity. The temporary helipad structure is likely related to 
a scheduled VIP visit (per open source reporting).
